 * The UserDAO object is not thread-safe as the underlying objectify instance
 * isn't thread-safe.  So, we provide a per thread DAO, which by construction will
 * be thread safe.
 * <p>This makes sense, I think, as a single thread will last at least one request,
 * and quite likely many more if the container does thread management.  Keeping
 * hold of the thread allows more caching, as the objectify instance caches.
